        3. Decentralized Governance (DAO): Vote on ecosystem decisions by staking SPL via a DAO smart contract.
        4. Decentralized Data Storage: Pay for and earn SPL through IPFS-based decentralized file storage.
        5. Document Verification with DID: Use SPL to hash and verify document authenticity via Decentralized Identifiers.

  utter_ask_spl_payment:
    - text: |
        SPL tokens are used for peer-to-peer transactions in the Walchain ecosystem.
        Key features:
        - Instant finality: Transactions confirm in 2–5 seconds.
        - Low fees: Thanks to ZK-Rollups, typical transaction fees are only 0.01 SPL.
        - Scalability: Multi-chain sharding allows up to 5,000 TPS.
        - Example: Pay 20 SPL for coffee or send 100 SPL cross-border with negligible cost.
        Transactions are handled by Light Validators via the Quorum Slice or SCP fallback consensus.

  utter_ask_spl_staking:

        In the long term, WaLX aims to become a decentralized and multi-chain exchange. This future version will connect SPL to other blockchains, offering greater liquidity, cross-chain trading, and access to millions of global users.

  utter_about_lbr:
    - text: |
        The Liquidity Bootstrapping Round (LBR) is a smart fundraising mechanism designed to kickstart the SuperWAL ecosystem. In this round, users contribute USDT to power SuperUP—a system that boosts your mining rate. In return, you earn SPL tokens through automated refunds.
        The LBR begins with a pool of 5 million SPL paired with USDT. When SPL is distributed, the pool is automatically replenished from reserves using a smart contract, maintaining stability and long-term growth.

  utter_about_superup:
    - text: |
        SuperUP is your personal power booster inside the SuperWAL ecosystem. By spending USDT to accelerate SuperUP, you increase your mining speed and influence within the network. The more you boost, the more SPL tokens you’re eligible to receive.
        It’s also your key to participating in the Liquidity Bootstrapping Round (LBR), where all contributions are handled transparently via smart contracts.

  utter_about_spl_refunds:
    - text: |
        When you use USDT to boost SuperUP, you get rewarded with SPL token refunds. These refunds represent your contribution and are automatically credited to your Vaults spot wallet.
        The refund rate depends on your activity and the current pool status. This system ensures that early contributors gain more tokens and have a larger impact on the development of the ecosystem.

  utter_about_lbr_benefits:
    - text: |
        Participating in LBR offers multiple benefits:
        ✅ Early access to SPL tokens before public exchange trading  
        ✅ Earning opportunities through refunds into your wallet  
        ✅ Transparent, automated process powered by smart contracts  
        ✅ Support for long-term token value through sustainable liquidity  
        ✅ Contribution to the decentralized SuperWAL financial system
        By joining early, you’re not just earning tokens—you’re helping shape the future of the SuperWAL ecosystem.

  utter_about_walx_vision:
    - text: |
        The long-term vision of WaLX Exchange is to become a decentralized, global, and multi-chain trading platform. After the initial internal launch, where users can trade SPL using an order book system, WaLX will expand to:
