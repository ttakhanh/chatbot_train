#Mining structure
  utter_explain_mining_structure:
    - text: |
        The **Mining Speed (SPL/h)** in SPL Mining is calculated using the following advanced formula:

        \[
        \text{Mining Speed (SPL/h)} = \sqrt{x} - 0.15 \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{20(\sqrt{x} - 1)} \frac{e^t}{(1 + e^t)^2} dt
        \]

        Where:
        - **x = Base rate × SuperUP × Boosters × Rewards**
        - `Base rate`: system's minimum mining output
        - `SuperUP`: your dynamic multiplier based on activity
        - `Boosters`: tasks, referral bonuses, etc.
        - `Rewards`: platform incentives and achievements

        🧠 This structure is designed to **encourage team collaboration and community growth**, ensuring that active users earn more fairly.

        ⚡ The integral component introduces a progressive difficulty model, making mining **more sustainable** over time.

  utter_base_rate:
    - text: |
        The Base Rate is the fundamental mining value, calculated as:

        **Base Rate** = AP × Base Score  
        Default Base Score = 0.0005 SPL/h

        **AP (Activity Points)** are earned through task completions and will be unlocked soon. By default, each user starts with AP = 1. This rate ensures everyone can participate in mining regardless of hardware.

  utter_superup_overview:
    - text: |
        SuperUP is a voluntary sponsorship mechanism in the SuperWAL ecosystem. It allows users to contribute WaLX tokens to support the long-term development of the project. In return, users receive benefits like increased SPL mining speed and SPL token refunds, but it does not unlock any exclusive features. All users still have equal access to core functionalities.

  utter_superup_formula:
    - text: |
        The SuperUP rate is calculated as follows:
        SuperUP = 50 * ln(0.0025x + 1) + Beta + 1
        Where:
        - x = Total Sponsor (total amount of WaLX you’ve contributed)
        - Beta = 15% of the combined SuperUP rate of your referral team
        This formula rewards both individual contribution and team participation.

  utter_superup_purpose:
    - text: |
        SuperUP serves several purposes in the SuperWAL ecosystem:
        1. **Support Development** – Helps fund ongoing advancements like ZK-Rollup, SCP, and Walchain infrastructure.
        2. **Community Building** – Contributors are recognized as Sponsors and help grow the Web3 ecosystem.
        3. **Increased SPL Mining Speed** – Contributions increase your mining rate, allowing you to earn more SPL.
        Remember, participation is 100% voluntary and not required for using SuperWAL features.

  utter_superup_mechanism:
    - text: |
        SuperUP is completely voluntary. All users can fully access SuperWAL features—mining, content, and community—without contributing.
        Contributions are made in WaLX and cannot be refunded in cash. However, they are eligible for SPL token refunds through an internal exchange rate.

  utter_superup_refund:
    - text: |
        While SuperUP contributions are not refundable in fiat or stablecoins, you will receive **SPL tokens** as a refund. The refund rate is determined transparently by SuperWAL's internal exchange rate between WaLX and SPL.
        This SPL can be used within the ecosystem, such as for mining or accessing future platform utilities. SPL cannot be withdrawn or traded outside the app.

#Boosters Rewards
  utter_booster_overview:
    - text: |
        Booster is a feature that helps increase your SPL rewards by joining a local community via Meeting Points. When you're near other users (within 200 meters), you gain additional rewards through the Community Circle Rate and Get Reward.

  utter_booster_location_required:
    - text: |
        The app requests location access to detect your proximity to other users, create Meeting Points, and calculate Community Circle Rate. Location updates occur once per minute when the app is open and are not tracked in real-time.

  utter_booster_meeting_point:
    - text: |
        A Meeting Point is created when you open the app and allow location access. The system identifies users within a 200-meter radius who are actively mining SPL to calculate the Community Circle Rate.

  utter_booster_calculation:
    - text: |
        Booster = (1 + Community Circle Rate + Get Reward)  
        Where:
        - Community Circle Rate = Number of meeting point members × 30%
        - Boost duration: 60 minutes
        - Get Reward: Additional reward depending on your activity

  utter_booster_privacy:
    - text: |
        Your location is only used for the Booster feature and is never shared with third parties. Data is stored temporarily and automatically deleted after 60 minutes of inactivity.

  utter_booster_benefits:
    - text: |
        Booster allows you to earn more SPL rewards by mining near other users. It enhances community engagement and creates a more interactive experience, without compromising your privacy or draining your device resources.

#Members Rewards
  utter_member_rewards_explanation:
    - text: |
        Member Rewards are points you earn by inviting others to join your team and mine SPL tokens. The more verified, active miners in your referral network, the higher your rewards. These rewards help increase your mining speed and overall earning rate.

  utter_member_rewards_calculation:
    - text: |
        Member Rewards are calculated using the formula:

        \[
        \text{Rewards} = (\text{User Type} + \text{Verified Mining Team} \times 25\%)
        \]

        - User Type Score:
          - Normal = 1
          - Pioneer = 3
          - Distributor = 5
          - Partner = 7

        - Verified Mining Team includes members you referred, who:
          - Have verified their email
          - Are currently mining
        
        Only active users contribute to your team rewards.

  utter_member_rewards_tips:
    - text: |
        To boost your Member Rewards:
        1. Invite more people using your referral link.
        2. Make sure they verify their email and stay active in mining.
        3. Educate your team about reactivating mining every 24 hours.
